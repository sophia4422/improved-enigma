The lengthy queues women often wait makes perfect sense when you consider the facts, female anatomy, culture, combined with the notion that there are generally less toilets to use in the women's space. 
            </br>
          </br>
              What really shocked me during my research were the comments from the general public who often blame women for the long queues on things like doing makeup and talking too much, and shamed anyone who wanted to do something about it:

            A study was led to  <span class="font-bold">solve the problem of a 6 minute wait time for women</span>  by two researchers: Kurt Vanhautegem and Wouter Rogiest. They proposed and tested a variety of layouts, with the optimum combining the spaces of male/female toilets to make one gender-neutral bathroom.

                    My first thought was while this reduced the women's average waiting time by almost 5 minutes, it increased the men's average waiting time by over 40 seconds, which some may argue is not completely fair.

    It was also clear that the researchers had  <span class="font-bold">not considered women's thoughts and opinions in the design of this layout.</span>  So I decided to ask women what they thought of this solution...

  I also asked some men how they might feel about this bathroom. One interesting point made was one man said he'd feel uncomfortable on behalf of any woman or child that might walk past, and them having to see men using the urinals. However, the men I asked said they would not mind using a gender neutral space in general.

                              Most concepts of female urinals seem to just be squat toilets, which are very common in Eastern countries. However, my research group agreed these are just toilets, not urinals.

                          Also, squat toilets alienate those with any sort of mobility issues from using them.

      Perhaps a female urinal that can be used as both a squat toilet and one that you can stand over may be a solution. Then the choice of use is
      by the user. 
                    </br>
                  </br>
                    If you stand over the urinal, you do not need to remove garments completely, and this would allow those that might have accessibility issues (e.g. unable to squat) to use them.
                  </br>
                </br>
                These urinals could still be contained in a cubicle, which would still take up space in a bathroom compared to male urinals, but might reduce the time a user lingers in the bathroom, therefore  <span class="font-bold">decreasing queue time.</span>

            This has been a really interesting investigation, as it is something that has affected me personally but I was not even aware about it until I began my research! 
            Conducting a presentation and small research group has assisted in improving my speaking and leadership skills. I look forward to the next opportunity to do this again.
            

          </br>

        I highly recommend anyone, especially those interested in User Experience, to read <a href="https://carolinecriadoperez.com/book/invisible-women/" target="_blank" class="pink">
          'Invisible Women' by Caroline Criado Perez</a>. It is an eye-opening and interesting book that will alter your perception of lots of aspects of life (from the interesting to the mundane) that are filled with unintentional biases.
