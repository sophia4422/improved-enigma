                    My first thought was while this reduced the women's average waiting time by almost 5 minutes, it increased the men's average waiting time by over 40 seconds, which some may argue is not completely fair.

    It was also clear that the researchers had not considered women's thoughts and opinions in the design of this layout. So I decided to ask women what they thought of this solution...

   The user can <span class="font-bold">personalise</span> their profile by adding a profile photo and cover photo. All personal details, such as email and subscription type, will only be visible to the user. When the user subscribes to the application, they will be able to access a variety of drumming tutorials and live shows, created by world class drummers.

  </br>
</br>
   Users can view drumming events, that have only been curated by the Palace Drum Clinic. A user can save an event they like the look of (this data will give marketers an idea of event interest), or they can buy tickets for the event - both saved and attending events will be shown only to the user on their profile.
  </br>
</br>
Drumming tutorials are organised by their skill ability (beginner, intermediate etc) and their popularity amongst users. Videos can be viewed on demand and saved to a users personal playlist for later. Scheduled live shows will also be available to view. Videos do not only encompass tutorials, but also interviews and informal chats with the popular drummers, so users can get to know them on a more personal level.
</br>
</br>
Users can look through a list of the drumming artists available on the app and view their public profiles - this includes photos, a bio and the videos created or featuring said artist.

           This prototype was presented to the PDC at their annual drum clinic where product owners feedback was received. The product was granted permission to be built, and currently it is in the works with the developer. Depending on how the community respond to the app will affect whether or not we can bring the product to life past the MVP and create more exciting and unique features.

            All of the research, planning and discussion is so valuable in order to design a viable and successful product. It is not all about how the product looks - I have learnt that lesson now.

        When I get the chance to repeat this project again for the next stage of designs, I am going to do my utmost to involve as much testing as possible.

        </br>
      </br>
          <span class="font-bold">Don't rush into things:</span> All I wanted to do was design the product. I have learnt that skipping steps, and not following the process properly (which in my defence, I didn't know how to do), leads to a poorly executed product. Planning, discussion and research are vital elements to get a better quality result.
        </br>
      </br>
        <span class="font-bold">Designing is like Science:</span> I studied BioMed at Uni and I know the importance of hypothesing, planning and testing - I never thought that these sort of elements would be important in designing. Now I feel that these things are in many ways, more important than the final result itself, because without them, you do not get reliable, repeatable results.
    </br>
</br>
<span class="font-bold">Start from scratch:</span> Hitting a road block? Feeling overwhelmed? Not getting anywhere? It is okay to just start again if you need to. I try so hard to strive for perfection, which is impossible, so I need to accept that. What you make the first time is not always going to be the best, and infact, doing things a few times makes you better at it. Making mistakes is vital to the learning process.
