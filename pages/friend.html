          <p class="mb-5 lead">
            Friends keep us company through the ups and downs of our lives and help us grow. But as we grow older, our fear and social anxiety can keep us from making new friends. How can you help people who have social anxiety to step out and make new friends?

        <div class="m-4">
          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Problem</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">
           Some people face challenges in making new friends due to social anxiety and fear - this inhibits their ability to connect with others, leaving them isolated and hindering personal growth.
          </br>
         How might we empower individuals with social anxiety to overcome the first step out of their comfort zones in order to make new friends, receive companionship and eliviate feelings of loneliness?

            <p class="lead">
              Design and build an app based on friendship, discovering new people with similar interests and opportunities to attend events. The app will act as a friend itself, offering a safe and inclusive platform that enables like-minded users to connect. The app will allow users to curate a personalised profile about their hobbies and interests, and utilise personalised matching algorithms to meet others. Users can message one another in the app safely, and the app will offer optional ice-breaker prompts in order to initiate the conversation. Additionally, the app will offer resources, communities and guidance to navigate users with social anxiety and boost their confidence. By creating an accessible and empowering digitial space, the friendship-based app will facilitate personal growth, enhance well-being and alleviate loneliness users may feel.

It will focus on personalised matching algorithms, personalised user profiles, ability for users to message, community engagement, event planning, privacy and safety and a focus on supporting those with social anxiety. The app will position itself as a go-to platform for making meaningful connections with like-minded people.

 Whilst working at the BBC, I have learnt the importance of having a style / design system. The BBC have the 'Global Experience Language', a system of reusable interaction patterns. Even though I was working solo on this project, I knew that creating a mini design system of my own will assist with saving time, keeping things consistent and improve the overall look of the project and be very beneficial for the developer building the application! As a developer myself, I am biased to the last point in particular - having repeatable components makes developing an application much less painful and time consuming.
