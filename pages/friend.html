I work in marketing. I am looking for new and accepting friends who can show me around town!
          The final photo says: Say Aloha to new friendships. The app's ability to offer ice-breaker prompts is also shown, with sayings like "Send Leo a book recommendation" and "Ask Yewande about her travels".

      enjoys reading. Laura works
      as a remote freelance writer
      and feels socially isolated.
      Challenges: Laura experiences social anxiety and finds it hard to initiate conversations.
      Laura prefers gradual and low pressure interactions.
      Goals: Laura wants to connect with those that share her passion for literature. She desires meaningful conversations, book recommendations and to join a book club.
      Expectations: Laura expects the app to suggest
      compatible individuals who will partake in conversations around books. Laura expects the app to suggest ice-breaker conversation prompts.
      2: The Timid Tech Enthusiast: Amir. A black and white photo of a smiling south Asian man using a laptop. Background: Amir is a 29 year old Software Engineer who loves tech and video games. He has recently moved to a new city and wants to expand his circle.
      Challenges: Amir struggles to approach new
      people in social settings; he needs a
      platform that helps him overcome this barrier.
      Goals: Amir wants to meet new people who share his enthusiasm for tech and would like to collaborate on tech-related projects.
      Expectations: Amir expects the app to suggest friends with similar tech and gaming interests, provide event notifications, offer conversation starters and allow group planning activities.

      misses her old friends. As she
      is new to the area she doesn't
      know where to go in the town in order to meet people. 
      Challenges: Bobbie lacks knowledge on the local
      scene, making it hard to navigate the
      town and find opportunities to meet
      like-minded individuals.
      Goals: Bobbie wants to establish a 
      social network in town & 
      discover local places visit. 
      Expectations: Bobbie expects the app to provide 
      suggestions for local events, recommend interest-based groups and activities, facilitate private messaging for connecting with new friends.

    Whilst completing my UX research, I have found user personas to be a very polarising concept amongst UX designers. Personally, I have found them to be incredibly useful, it's a great way to combine my user research and eliminate any bias I had (concious and subconcious) to the design process.

As a developer, with a passion for design, I entered into the UX design process thinking that it would be time-consuming and unnecessary. Why bother with all this empathising and discussion, why not just go straight into the designing? I see how wrong I was and that thinking that way came from <span class="font-bold">a lack of understanding.</span> This journey so far has given me valuable insights, taught me that what I think is not always what others think and that my users are at the forefront of every step.

  <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Style Guide</h2>
  <p class="mb-5 lead">

As I was creating my app, I built the style guide as I went along. I had my colours, spacing and fonts prepared ahead of designing the high-fidelity frames, as I had checked these for <span class="font-bold">accessibility.</span>  The chosen colour scheme also had a hidden meaning: the <span class="font-bold">primary teal colour</span> represents a sense of calmness, trust and <span class="font-bold">friendliness.</span> The inspiring <span class="font-bold">cyan shade </span>is associated with liveliness, youth and <span class="font-bold">energy.</span> These colours also remind me of the ocean, which coincides with the spirit of Aloha.
  </br>
</br>
As I created my cards and buttons, I added them to my style guide, which acted as a <span class="font-bold">design system</span> - this prevented me from re-making items I had already made (such as cards) and they were available when I needed them, therefore I had reusable components which made the <span class="font-bold">design process even speedier.</span>

<p class="lead">My design system helped me to save time, keep things consistent, improve the overall look of the app and assist a developer who might build the app. As a developer myself, I am biased to the previous point in particular - having repeatable components makes developing an application much less painful and time consuming.</p>

For <span class="font-bold">virtual friendships</span> with like-minded people that may be <span class="font-bold">located further</span> away, <span class="font-bold">forums</span> offer a great <span class="font-bold">low-pressure</span> way to connect with those of similar interests.

Curated <span class="font-bold">blogs</span> offer <span class="font-bold">information and support on making friends,</span>  especially for those who have social anxiety. Blogs also offer advice for those that want to set up their own events, forums and community groups, as well as success stories on friendships made via Aloha.

            I would like to do user testing on my prototype and interate the design process to <span class="font-bold">improve the app based on user feedback.</span>  I would also like to do some exploration around the <span class="font-bold">algorithm</span> of the app - would matching people based on interests really be successful? Would initially hiding the photos and hiding age really help to <span class="font-bold">prevent judgement</span>  and encourage genuine friendships? 
          </br>
        </br>
            Bumble is the only friendship app with a complex algorithm that I can find information about, but all of the research I have done on this talks about the dating element of the app, and that algorithm is based on appearance and how frequently people get 'liked' - this does not align with the ethics of Aloha. I would like to get some <span class="font-bold">software engineers involved</span>  to discuss how the algorithm could operate.

            I have thoroughly enjoyed this process from start to finish. 
     
            As I have an engineering background, it has been nice to focus on the design side and <span class="font-bold">let my imagination run free,</span> without having the limitation of building the app. If I had to build this app, I would have set myself a ceiling with the designs, constantly thinking about how to make the app work behind the scenes, and this would have <span class="font-bold">limited my designs</span> and the <span class="font-bold">complexity</span> of the app.

                     I learnt a lesson when <span class="font-bold">I made a big mistake</span> during the high-fidelity design stage. I prepared my frames and set them to iPhone 14 dimensions, and then designed each and every frame.

                  </br>
                     I began to make the interactive prototype - only to discover, my frames were not iPhone 14 size and <span class="font-bold">did not fit</span> inside the prototype template.

Unfortunately, it was not as easy as simply scaling the existing frames down, each element had to be resized and repositioned. <span class="font-bold">I will never make that mistake again.</span> That could have been <span class="font-bold">extremely costly</span> if this was a real life app that had a real deadline. </p>

          My top takeways:
        </br>
      </br>
          <span class="font-bold">Love of design:</span> I have always loved designing apps and websites, and following the UX process made this go so much smoother and more enjoyable. I loved picking the colours and fonts, and creating the different components. I really put my heart into the designs.
        </br>
      </br>
        <span class="font-bold">The benefit of collaboration:</span> In order to improve this app, I would love to get other designers and users involved. The app needs testing and feedback - my user personas can only take me so far before my own biases creep into the designs and operation of the app. 
      </br>
    </br>
      <span class="font-bold">Check as you go:</span> It is so important that I double check things such as the dimensions of my prototype, my spacing, my colours etc as I go. I do not want to design a whole app in the wrong dimensions ever again! This will allow me to watch out for mistakes and save valuable time.
