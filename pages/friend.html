          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">The Challenge</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">
            The BBC offers a brilliant bi-annual hackathon event where those who design and build our website get a chance to take a hold of the products they work on and create something exciting, new and beneficial to our users. 
          </br>
            The theme of this challenge: Build Better Audience Communities. How could we advance our products and content formats to build better relationships with and between our users and audiences? 
          </br>
            Over the course of two hackathons, the Games team has developed the Games Index page to offer a personalised and unique experience for its users.

        <div class="m-4">
          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Problem</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">
            Currently, the BBC Games page simply displays the free HTML5 games for children – there is no option for personalisation and no interaction between players, and therefore we rely solely on the games themselves for user retention.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="m-4">
          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Hypothesis</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">
            By creating a more personalised and unique experience on the BBC Games Index page, users will stay on the page for longer, discover more games and our audience size will increase.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="grey-bg mb-5">
          <div class="m-2">
            <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Solution</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Design and build various components that will sit in the BBC Games Index page. One component will contain features that allow friends to interact, another will display the achievements the user has gained through game-play and the other will allow for the page to be personalised through the theming, colours and BBC branding that is so well known by our audience.

          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Competitor Analysis</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 lead">
            Together, the team thought about which brands make games and make them well. What do they do that we could explore? We looked into big names such as Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox and Steam, and outlined their community features on a Miro board. We summarised that these brands offer a gaming profile that all overlap with similar features such as: profile image, username, ability to add friends, trophies and achievements and online status. These are the kind of features that we wanted to implement to our games page community component.

          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">User Research</h2>
          <p class="mb-3 lead">
            Here are some insights we took from previous testing on the Games Index page:
          </p>
        </div>

  <div class=" row m-3 mb-5">
    <div class="col grey-pink m-1 d-flex align-items-center text-center"> <p class="text-center mb-0 p-3">“Categorised content helps children make a choice by reducing the number of options they have to take in at a time."

    </br> 2. This makes games easier to find

    <div class="col grey-pink m-1 text-center"> <p class=" m-0 p-4"> "Children usually play a couple of games in one session"
    </p> </div>
    <div class="col grey-pink m-1 d-flex align-items-center"> <p class="text-center mb-0 p-3"> Showing what games friends are playing / being able to favourite games will help with onward journeys.
    </p> </div>
  </div>

  <div class="m-4 mb-5">
    <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Friction Points</h2>
    <p class="mb-1 lead">
      Due to safeguarding and laws around storing information on children, we cannot allow users to sign-in or create an account. How might we get around this?</p>
     <p class="mb-3 lead italics"> Username is generated automatically for the user, they can refresh this to something else but they would not be able to write their name and release any personal info. Everything will be saved locally, not put in a database. </p>
    <p class="mb-1 lead">
      By displaying achievements, this may create a ‘jealousy’ element amongst users, and may decrease the enjoyment a user has on the games page.</p>
<p class="mb-3 lead italics"> Any in-game achievements by the user can only be seen by that user. Achievement information would be stored locally, not in a database. Users would not be able to see their friends achievements. </p>
 
    <p class="mb-1 lead">
      The component will sit at the top of the page and this will interfere with the promo space that gets displayed when editorial have a new game that they want to show. </p>
      <p class="mb-3 lead italics">It is very uncommon for the promo space to get used. However, if the promo space does need to be used, the friends and achievements component will take a lower priority down the page and the promo space will remain in the usual position. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="m-4">
    <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">MVP & Extra Features</h2>
    <p class="mb-3 lead">
      Considering the UX questions and previous user testing, Product, development and UX were able to decide on a list of modules to be included for an MVP (shown in the grey boxes). Other features were also decided to be implemented once the MVP was met (shown in the white boxes).

            A variety of screen designs were sketched out on paper, we discussed the layout and implementing carousels. The chosen sketch was then developed in Figma.

          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Development</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">After the prototype had been created in Figma, the real component was created using React. The developers were made up of a team of 6, split evenly into one frontend and one backend team. I was on the front-end team - this is all about shaping how the component looks on the page.

            The unique random username feature was generated with a nickname API.
            
            The container accesses a database on dynamoDB via an API gateway that fetches the friend data. The unique friend code is generated through a random UUID. The user obtains their friend code and is able to share and exchange the code to dynamically update their friend list. 
            
            We lacked time to implement the achievements section, so this information remained static for now.

            <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Component Summary</h2>
            <p class="mb-5 lead">The user is able to add friends by sharing their unique friend-code. This friend-code is generated randomly when the user first visits the index page, and the code is saved to the users local storage. 
              <br/> 
              The user cannot create their own username or profile picture, however they receive a randomly generated username and picture which they can re-roll at any time to receive a new one. They cannot go back if they change their mind. This name is also saved to local storage.
              <br/> 
              No personal data is inputted or saved. 
              <br/> 
              At this stage, users cannot see their friend's achievements.
              <br/> A user will lose their friends, username and picture if they clear their local storage.

          <p class="mb-1 lead">
            For the next hackathon, we wanted to build on the current prototype to shape it around the next theme entitled: ‘All about YOU’. We asked the question ‘How Might We make it feel like there is something personal for me on the children’s games page?’  
            The team got together and began brain storming...

      <p class="mb-5 lead">
        Then we each chose our favourite idea from the brain storming outcome. We played ‘Crazy 8s’ as a design sprint method where you take your favourite idea and develop it over 8 minutes.

    <p class="mb-5 lead">
      My crazy 8s idea was for children to choose from a list of popular CBBC characters, and in choosing one, the colour scheme of the page changes:

            This personalisation component was built on the same branch as the friend feature - we built this using React. Webcore has a carousel component which we implemented and the character images were stored in an S3 bucket. Logic was implemented that meant selecting a specific character would alter the state - and therefore, the colour of the components and the games displayed would change. The styling was done with CSS.

              Peruse through the list of five characters and preview the theme changing. 
              <br/>
              Select their chosen character and save the theme. This theme will persist until the user changes it again.
              <br/> The selected character will greet the user with a personalised greeting.

 The Hackathon is an amazing opportunity to take control of our Games Index page that we love and work on so much. To get the opportunity to transform the page so drastically in just a couple of weeks is a really rewarding and interesting experience. We get to work within our team and have external team members join in, who we would not ordinarily get to meet and work with - and with this you learn so many new things & ways of thinking and working. 
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3 lead">
            We managed to design and implement the components that we wanted to - and they work - which is always a good thing! We have presented our developments to the wider team and the Project Managers and Product Owners have shared it further with our stakeholders as potential for what our product could become in the future.

                      Completing this product has bought me a lot of confidence in my development skills, as it is a more laid-back way of engineering as there is not so much pressure to get things correct. I have also improved my UX knowledge and the hackathon has been a great way for me to get involved in the design side of things, rather than just the engineering side. Having knowledge of UX and Development is beneficial in sprints like this, as it is possible to set expectations on what can be built within the time frame and to not be too ambitious with the designs to avoid disappointment, and stress on the Engineers.

                               Something I have learnt and will take away from this experience is time management! Our time management skills as a team have certainly improved, but we did not budget enough time to make an amazing presentation video (the video you see above is one I made in my freetime), and the politics of the Hackathon usually mean the best video gets the most votes, not necessarily the best product! I can be competitive and I want our team to win!

                                          Takeaways:
                                          <br/>
                                          1. Confidence: The fact that my idea was chosen to be developed means a lot me, as it means others saw the value in my idea. My ability to contribute to the coding of the product has done wonders for my imposter syndrome. 
                                          <br/>
                                          2. Joy of design: I thoroughly love designing and being able to actually make the designs come to life is so rewarding.
