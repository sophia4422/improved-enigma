            Friends keep us company through the ups and downs of our lives - but as we grow older, our fear and social anxiety can keep us from making new friends. How might we empower <span class='font-bold'>individuals with social anxiety</span> to overcome the <span class="font-bold">first step out of their comfort zones</span> in order to <span class="font-bold">make new friends</span>, receive companionship and alleviate feelings of loneliness?

              <span class="font-bold">Design and build an app based on friendship</span>: allowing users to discover new people with similar interests and offer opportunities to attend events. <span class="font-bold">The app will act as a friend itself</span>, offering a safe and inclusive platform that enables like-minded users to connect. The app will allow users to curate a personalised profile about their hobbies and interests, and utilise personalised matching algorithms to meet others.

            </br>
          </br>
              Additionally, the app will offer resources, communities and guidance to navigate users with social anxiety and boost their confidence.

          <p class="mb-4 lead hidden">When I first learnt about whiteboard sessions, I thought it was just a silly idea. However, pushing myself in a confined time frame to really push out all of my initial thoughts amazed me - I didn't know I had that many thoughts already sitting in my head. The time pressure really forced my mind to think. I got so much benefit out such a small amount of time. In a real life scenario, I could see how this would be useful to whiteboard session with a project manager who might be crunched for time. This really helped me to progress to future stages.</p>

     Three user personas were created to represent the typical users.

        Whilst completing my UX research, I have found User Personas to be a very polarising concept amongst UX designers. Personally, I have found them to be incredibly useful - after making them, I found it to be a useful way of combining my user research and really eliminating any bias I had (concious and subconcious) to the design process. It kept empathy in the foreground, I am not designing for myself, or designing for what I like, I am designing for my users - and their needs vary from mine. </p>

            Next, I took the stages from my user journey map above, and created a sitemap to visualise the user journey. This acted as an efficient 'tick list' when the sketching process began, and when making my high-fidelity prototype later.

           With my framing the problem whiteboard session turning out positive for me, I set myself a timer and did a quick whiteboard session to map out the basic wireframes of the application. This was my chance to express the immediate ideas I had in my mind out on paper. Don't think too much, just sketch!

            I then took the above wireframes and developed them without the time pressure. Developing the wireframes in this way helped me to consider all the feedback from the research and come up with new ideas as I went along, I made notes on my wireframes as new ideas came to mind, such as an option to 'wave' at matched friends - a low pressure way of starting a conversation.

<p class="mb-2 lead">
  I sat back and reflected on the wireframes above, and developed them once again without time pressure. I felt my designs and sketches had improved with every iteration - and more ideas came to me each time. The app was growing like a rolling snowball - I had limited time, and was only one designer, it was time to reign it in.

  I then reflected on these drawings and felt overwhelmed by the amount of information on them. It is great to have some notes to refer to for future development, but it was time to make my designs more succinct. I needed my wireframes to be clearer so that developers, clients, designers... and myself... get a clear understanding of the functionalities, and overall design look. So, I translated the sketches to low-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq for better detail and screen accuracy:

            This was my first time using Balsamiq and I loved it! All of the icons and feature templates (such as photo, loading bar, nav bar etc) are pre-made. It was a simple case of picking the appropriate feature and matching it to my sketches. It was so time consuming vs in the past making all the features from scratch myself!

  With my wire-frames in hand, it would be ideal at this stage to complete some user testing on them. As this was a solo UX development project, I did not do this. However, I understand how vital it is to get critism and feedback, and make important alterations, before the high-fidelity product is designed. Instead, I considered my user personas and what they might think. Before I began, I ensured that I had my style guide ready - with colours, fonts and spacing checked for accessibility.

 Whilst working at the BBC, I have learnt the importance of having a style / design system. The BBC have the 'Global Experience Language', a system of reusable interaction patterns. Even though I was working solo on this project, I knew that creating a mini design system of my own will assist with saving time, keeping things consistent and improve the overall look of the project and be very beneficial for the developer building the application! As a developer myself, I am biased to the last point in particular - having repeatable components makes developing an application much less painful and time consuming.
