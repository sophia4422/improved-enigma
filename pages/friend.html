      <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Pit-Stop Reflections</h2>
<p class="mb-2 lead">
As a developer, with a passion for design, I entered into this UX process thinking that it would be time-consuming and unnecessary. Why bother with all this empathising and discussion, why not just go straight into the designing? After all, isn't designing what UX designers do? I see how wrong I was and that thinking that way came from <span class="font-bold">a lack of understanding.</span> This journey so far has given me valuable insights, taught me that what I think is not always what others think and that my users are at the forefront of every step. I will never, ever design the same way again after learning about <span class="font-bold">the importance of the user experience design process. </span>

          <p class="mb-3 lead">
            Next, I took the stages from my user journey map above, and created a site map to visualise the user journey and organise the web architecture. In a real-life scenario, I would have liked to sit down with participants to complete a 'card sort' to define the grouping of features and get others opinions on the information architecture.
            In this case of a solo designer, I instead analysed my competitors' site maps and came up with my own in a similar vein. I found this site map to act as an efficient 'tick list' when the sketching process began, and when making my high-fidelity prototype later.

          <p class="mb-5 lead">
           With my framing the problem whiteboard session turning out positive for me, I set myself a timer and did a quick whiteboard session to map out the basic wireframes of the application (crazy 8s style). This was my chance to express the immediate ideas I had in my mind out on paper. Don't think too much, just sketch!
          </p>

          <p class="mb-2 lead">
            I then took the above wireframes and developed them without the time pressure. Developing the wireframes in this way helped me to <span class="font-bold">consider all the feedback from the initial user research</span> and inspire new ideas as I went along, I made notes on my wireframes as new ideas came to mind, such as an option to 'wave' at matched friends - a low pressure way of starting a conversation.

<p class="mb-2 lead">
  I sat back and reflected on the wireframes above, and developed them once again without time pressure. I felt my designs and sketches had improved with every iteration - and more ideas came to me each time. The app was growing like a rolling snowball - I had limited time, and was only one designer, it was time to reign it in.

<h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Mid Fidelity Wireframing</h2>
<p class="mb-5 lead">
  I then looked over my low-fidelity wireframes and felt overwhelmed by the amount of information on them. It is great to have some notes to refer to for future development, but it was time to make my designs more succinct. I needed my wireframes to be straight forward so that developers, clients, designers... and myself... get a clear understanding of the functionalities, and overall design. I translated the sketches to low-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq for better detail and screen accuracy.

            I really enjoyed using Balsamiq to create these wireframes. All of the icons and feature templates (such as photo, loading bar, nav bar etc) are pre-made. It was a simple case of picking the appropriate feature and matching it to my sketches. In the past, I would have made all the features from scratch myself, so using Balsamiq was much more <span class="font-bold">time-effective.</span>

  With my wireframes in hand, it would be ideal at this stage to complete some user testing on them. As this was a solo UX development project, I did not have others on hand to help me with this. However, I understand how vital it is to get <span class="font-bold">critism and feedback,</span>  and make important alterations, before the high-fidelity product is designed. Instead, I considered my user personas and what they might think.

  I was suprised at the speedy progress I was making. Before, when I have jumped straight into the design process, it would have taken me <span class="font-bold">twice as long</span> to get to a final product. I thought that all of this researching, and wireframing process, would make things go even slower. But actually, I had all of my notes and my sketches ready and <span class="font-bold">I felt confident to begin the high-fidelity prototyping stage.</span> On previous design projects, I would have jumped straight into the high-fidelity prototyping stage (because this is the fun part) but then find myself hitting a road block and asking myself things like: Where is this page meant to lead next? What features am I designing again?

  <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Style Guide</h2>
  <p class="mb-5 lead">

As I was creating my app, I built the style guide as I went along. I had my colours, spacing and fonts prepared ahead of designing the high-fidelity frames, as I had checked these for <span class="font-bold">accessibility.</span>  The chosen colour scheme also had a hidden meaning: the <span class="font-bold">primary teal colour</span> represents a sense of calmness, trust and <span class="font-bold">friendliness.</span> The inspiring <span class="font-bold">cyan shade </span>is associated with liveliness, youth and <span class="font-bold">energy.</span> These colours also remind me of the ocean, which coincides with the spirit of Aloha.
  </br>
</br>
As I created my cards and buttons, I added them to my style guide, which acted as a <span class="font-bold">design system</span> - this prevented me from re-making items I had already made (such as cards) and they were available when I needed them, therefore I had reusable components which made the <span class="font-bold">design process even speedier.</span>

<p class="lead">My design system helped me to save time, keep things consistent, improve the overall look of the app and assist a developer who might build the app. As a developer myself, I am biased to the previous point in particular - having repeatable components makes developing an application much less painful and time consuming.</p>

<h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">High Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p class="mb-5 lead">
Using Figma, the mid-fidelity wireframes were transformed into high-fidelity wireframes, and then an interactive prototype. After adding improvements, colour, finer details, and making a very large mistake (which I will tell you about in my learning and reflections section), my wireframes were ready.

   The user will <span class="font-bold">personalise</span> their profile by adding photos of themselves and writing a bio. The user can opt to pick <span class="font-bold">experiences</span> (such as religion, education, politics), and pick <span class="font-bold">interests</span> (such as reading, reggae and rock climbing) - this feeds the algorithm and <span class="font-bold">matches uses based on similar interests. </span>
  </br>
</br>
   The matching algorithm is also controlled by <span class="font-bold">prompts:</span> a user picks up to five of these prompts, which are generated based on the interests they chose. For example, if you selected hiking as an interest, the user can pick a prompt called 'A recent hiking adventure' where they can add a photo of a view and the location. This makes the profile<span class="font-bold">more interesting to read</span> and is more <span class="font-bold">personable</span> to other users.
  </br>
</br>
When a user is ready to start viewing friend matches, they are <span class="font-bold">not initially shown any photos</span> of the potential friend - this is to <span class="font-bold">avoid judgement</span> and 'window-shopping', instead the user is shown the potential friend's name and their matching interests. The user can choose to view the potential friend's profile, where they will see photos, bio, prompts etc - or they can <span class="font-bold">wave</span> to the potential friend, which is a <span class="font-bold">low-pressure</span> way of initiating conversation.
</br>
</br>
<span class="font-bold">Age</span> is also a feature that <span class="font-bold">is not shown</span> on anyones profile - instead a user can opt to show their star sign. The app is all about compatibility and friendship - and age could be a <span class="font-bold">discriminating factor.</span> I would have liked to have tested this with potential users and received their feedback on this.

When a user views a potential friend's profile, their personalised prompts will show <span class="font-bold">ice-breakers</span>, which encourages the user to <span class="font-bold">begin a conversation.</span> For example, if a potential friend has chosen baking as an interest and their corresponding prompt is 'My favourite thing to bake' with a photo of some brownies, the ice-breaker prompt will show the user 'Ask [potential friend] for the recipe!' - when the ice-breaker is clicked, the user will be taken to the messaging area of the app.
</br>
</br>
The idea of ice-breakers is to help <span class="font-bold">avoid awkward, boring conversations </span>and make meaningful connections - it also encourages the user to show an interest in the potential friend, rather than just talk about themselves.

For <span class="font-bold">virtual friendships</span> with like-minded people that may be <span class="font-bold">located further</span> away, <span class="font-bold">forums</span> offer a great <span class="font-bold">low-pressure</span> way to connect with those of similar interests.

Would initially hiding the photos and hiding age really help prevent judgement and encourage genuine friendships? Bumble is the only friendship app with a complex algorithm that I can find information about, but all of the research I have done on this talks about the dating element of the app, and that algorithm is based on appearance and how frequently people get 'liked' - this does not align with the ethics of Aloha.

            I have thoroughly enjoyed this process from start to finish. It has been so informative on about UX design, the double diamond process and empathising with users. 
          </br>
        </br>
            As I have an engineering background, it has been nice to focus on the design side and <span class="font-bold">let my imagination run free,</span> without having the limitation of building the app. If I had to build this app, I would have set myself a ceiling with the designs, constantly thinking about how to make the app work behind the scenes, and this would have <span class="font-bold">limited my designs</span> and the <span class="font-bold">complexity</span> of the app.
          </br>
        </br>
            I am happy with the overall app design and I feel my UI skills have improved. Maybe I am biased because this app has become my baby, but I would actually really like to try to build this app in React Native and make it come to life.

            I learnt a lesson when <span class="font-bold">I made a big mistake</span> during the high-fidelity design stage. I prepared my frames and set them to iPhone 14 dimensions, and then designed each and every frame. When I was done, I began to make the interactive prototype - only to discover, my frames were not iPhone 14 size and <span class="font-bold">did not fit</span> inside the prototype template.

          My top takeways:
        </br>
      </br>
          <span class="font-bold">Love of design:</span> I have always loved designing apps and websites, and following the UX process made this go so much smoother and more enjoyable. I loved picking the colours and fonts, and creating the different components. I really put my heart into the designs.
        </br>
      </br>
        <span class="font-bold">The benefit of collaboration:</span> In order to improve this app, I would love to get other designers and users involved. The app needs testing and feedback - my user personas can only take me so far before my own biases creep into the designs and operation of the app. 
      </br>
    </br>
      <span class="font-bold">Check as you go:</span> It is so important that I double check things such as the dimensions of my prototype, my spacing, my colours etc as I go. I do not want to design a whole app in the wrong dimensions ever again! This will allow me to watch out for mistakes and save valuable time.
