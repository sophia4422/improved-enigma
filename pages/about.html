Designing products that contribute to society, researching the users I am designing for, learning about how to increase user retention & loyalty, emphathising with users to make their experience accessible and enjoyable... That sounds like a bit of me!
</br>
</br>
I am currently working at the BBC as a Junior Software Engineer, but I take every opportunity to learn and speak with current UX designers & get involved with UX projects. I am really hopeful that my future will head towards a career in UX design.
