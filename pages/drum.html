              Design a user-friendly and engaging application that empowers users to improve their drumming skills through  <span class="font-bold">high-quality video tutorials and support from world class drumming teachers</span> .

            The developer and I outlisted the various screens a user would visit and we created a sitemap. This was useful to know what pages I needed to design and the journey for the prototype.
            We took our competitors into consideration, and tried to create the web-architecture based around the features that our app contains.

              <span class="font-bold">This is where any UX knowledge I had learned took a halt.</span>   I knew that you had to wireframe and sketch to begin designing process, but I did not to how to execute this properly. <span class="font-bold">I created some basic wireframes for the purposes of showing the developer,</span>  but they were not there to benefit me.

            Now that I am better educated on the importance of sketching and wireframing, I understand how valuable they are in planning and sparking ideas. I know my high-fidelity wireframes would have looked so much better if I had known how to develop and design properly.

Heading straight into Figma, armed with only the house-style colours (which I had not even checked for accessibility), the site map and the user persona, I began designing my high-fidelity product and prototype. I cringe at the thought of this now.

          <span class="font-bold">üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Don't rush into things:</span> All I wanted to do was design the product. I have learnt that skipping steps, and not following the process properly (which in my defence, I didn't know how to do), leads to a poorly executed product. Planning, discussion and research are vital elements to get a better quality result.
        </br>
      </br>
        <span class="font-bold">üë©‚Äçüî¨ Designing is like Science:</span> I studied BioMed at Uni and I know the importance of hypothesing, planning and testing - I never thought that these sort of elements would be important in designing. Now I feel that these things are in many ways, more important than the final result itself, because without them, you do not get reliable, repeatable results.
    </br>
</br>
<span class="font-bold">‚úèÔ∏è Start from scratch:</span> Hitting a road block? Feeling overwhelmed? Not getting anywhere? It is okay to just start again if you need to. I try so hard to strive for perfection, which is impossible, so I need to accept that. What you make the first time is not always going to be the best, and infact, doing things a few times makes you better at it. Making mistakes is vital to the learning process.
