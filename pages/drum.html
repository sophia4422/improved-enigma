              The Palace Drum Clinic is a charity looking to inspire and assist drummers of all levels. They have created a mobile app and desktop platform which shows exclusive drumming content and tutorials. I was responsible for the UX/UI aspects of this application.
             </br>

            <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">The Challenge</h2>
            <p class="mb-5 lead ">
              Design a user-friendly and engaging application that empowers users to improve their drumming skills through high-quality video tutorials and support from world class drumming teachers. The application must be scalable to a mobile and a desktop version. As this is for a charity, it has a very limited budget, and is centered around helping the community.

            <p class="mb-5 lead ">
             The first thing I did was dive straight into designing the mockup using Photoshop. This was before I knew anything about the UX Design process. I had no idea who my users were, what features I was designing, the architecture of the app - I had no guidelines.</p>

             <p class="lead"> I just started designing what I liked, what I thought would work, with no thought given to any users. My main concern was for the developer building the app, as I wanted my designs to be straightforward to recreate. I was completely biased in the mind of a developer. It is no wonder I was disappointed with the design outcome...

            The developer and I outlisted the various screens a user would visit and we created a sitemap. This was useful to know what pages I needed to design and the journey for the prototype.
            We took our competitors into consideration, and tried to create the web-architecture based around the features that our app contains.

            <p class="mb-3 lead">
              This is where any UX knowledge I had learned took a halt. I knew that you had to wireframe and sketch to begin designing process, but I was ignorant to how to execute this properly. I created some basic wireframes for the purposes of showing the developer, but they were not there to benefit me. All I wanted to do was design the mockup and prototype! 
            </br>
        </br>
            Now that I am better educated on the importance of sketching and wireframing, I understand how valuable they are in planning and sparking ideas. I know my high-fidelity wireframes would have looked so much better if I had known how to develop and design properly.

Heading straight into Figma, armed with only the house-style colours (which I had not even checked for accessibility), the site map and the user persona, I began designing my high-fidelity product and prototype. I cringe at the thought of this now.

            This was my first 'proper' design project, so to speak, and I would love to start all over again from the beginning and follow the UX design process properly to see what product I would create.

        </br>
            All of the research, planning and discussion is so valuable in order to design a viable and successful product. It is not all about how the product looks - I have learnt that lesson now. 
        </br>
    </br>
        When I get the chance to repeat this project again for the next stage of designs, I am going to do my utmost to involve as much testing as possible. This product is all about helping the community and inspire people to get involved in drumming, so it is important to get the community's feedback and advice at every stage of development.

          My top takeways:
        </br>
      </br>
          <span class="font-bold">Don't rush into things:</span> All I wanted to do was design the product. I have learnt that skipping steps, and not following the process properly (which in my defence, I didn't know how to do), leads to a poorly executed product. Planning, discussion and research are vital elements to get a better quality result.
        </br>
      </br>
        <span class="font-bold">Designing is like Science:</span> I studied BioMed at Uni and I know the importance of hypothesing, planning and testing - I never thought that these sort of elements would be important in designing. Now I feel that these things are in many ways, more important than the final result itself, because without them, you do not get reliable, repeatable results.
    </br>
</br>
<span class="font-bold">Start from scratch:</span> Hitting a road block? Feeling overwhelmed? Not getting anywhere? It is okay to just start again if you need to. I try so hard to strive for perfection, which is impossible, so I need to accept that. What you make the first time is not always going to be the best, and infact, doing things a few times makes you better at it. Making mistakes is vital to the learning process.
