            <p class="lead mb-3">
             During my time on the Coding Bootcamp, I expressed an interest for designing any of the websites that we would build as part of our development projects. When the Bootcamp was over, my developer friend Josh asked me to help him design an application and website he was working on for a drumming charity called the Palace Drum Clinic. Willing to help my friend and help a charity, I jumped at this opportunity.

        </br>
        I drove straight into designing the mockup. I thoroughly enjoy designing website and app mockups - but at this time, this was just graphic design - I had no knowledge of what UX was and the process. I made my first mock up of the application, and it was bad.
     I then started studying the UX design process, but it was just minimal and free resources that I found on YouTube - I had not invested in my learning at this point. I then had a very vague idea on the process (competitive analysis, user personas etc), and decided to incorporate the minimal knowledge I knew into this drumming project. My designs improved tremendously. 
    </br>
</br>
Present day me has had the wonderful opportunity to speak with many UX Designers, Researchers and Architects since making this project. I have also done lots of studying with online teachers such as CareerFoundary, KickassUX and Coursera. I now understand the value of doing the UX processes properly from start to finish, and how it actually helps to save so much time. So the project you are about to view really encompasses my development. It represents me in my infancy of UX, and more focused on UI designs.

            <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">The Challenge</h2>
            <p class="mb-5 lead ">
              Design a user-friendly and engaging application that empowers users to improve their drumming skills through high-quality video tutorials and support from world class drumming teachers. The application must be scalable to a mobile and a desktop version. As this is for a charity, it has a very limited budget, and is centered around helping the community.

             As mentioned in the overview, the first thing I did was dive straight into designing the mockup using Photoshop. This was before I knew anything about the UX Design process. I had no idea who my users were, what features I was designing, the architecture of the app - I had no guidelines.</p>

              I hit a road block, I hated my designs and I was lost on the direction of the app. After doing some studying of the UX step process, I decided to start from scratch. I wanted to ensure a user-centered approach, gain insights and develop a better, more organised product.

              I surveyed those that currently work for the drum clinic and a selection of those that are beginners to drumming or are intermediate learners (54 users). I gave these users 10 questions to gain quantitative insights. Here were the results:</p>

When the user subscribes to the application, they will be able to access a variety of drumming tutorials and live shows, created by world class drummers.

  </br>

   Users can view drumming events, that have only been curated by the Palace Drum Clinic. A user can save an event they like the look of (this data will give marketers an idea of event interest), or they can buy tickets for the event - both saved and attending events will be shown only to the user on their profile.

Drumming tutorials are organised by their skill ability (beginner, intermediate etc) and their popularity amongst users. Videos can be viewed on demand and saved to a users personal playlist for later. Scheduled live shows will also be available to view. Videos do not only encompass tutorials, but also interviews and informal chats with the popular drummers, so users can get to know them on a more personal level.

           This prototype was presented to the PDC at their annual drum clinic where product owners feedback was received. The product was granted permission to be built, and currently it is in the works with the developer. Depending on how the community respond to the app will affect whether or not we can bring the product to life past the MVP and create more exciting and unique features.

          For now, the MVP has been created and it is up to the developer to build it. In the future, we want to develop the application to have a '30 day challenge' section, this is where users complete daily challenges to build up a streak - if they complete 30 days, their skills are statistically likely to have improved, and they win a prize (prize idea pending).

          <p class="mb-2 lead">
            This was my first 'proper' design project, so to speak, and I would love to start all over again from the beginning and follow the UX design process properly to see what product I would create.
        </br>
    </br>
        All of the research, planning and discussion is so valuable in order to design a viable and successful product. It is not all about how the product looks - I have learnt that lesson now. 
    </br>
</br>
    When I get the chance to repeat this project again for the next stage of designs, I am going to do my utmost to involve as much testing as possible. This product is all about helping the community and inspire people to get involved in drumming, so it is important to get the community's feedback and advice at every stage of development.

          My top takeways:
        </br>
      </br>
          <span class="font-bold">Don't rush into things:</span> All I wanted to do was design the product. I have learnt that skipping steps, and not following the process properly (which in my defence, I didn't know how to do), leads to a poorly executed product. Planning, discussion and research are vital elements to get a better quality result.
        </br>
      </br>
        <span class="font-bold">Designing is like Science:</span> I studied BioMed at Uni and I know the importance of hypothesing, planning and testing - I never thought that these sort of elements would be important in designing. Now I feel that these things are in many ways, more important than the final result itself, because without them, you do not get reliable, repeatable results.
    </br>
</br>
<span class="font-bold">Start from scratch:</span> Hitting a road block? Feeling overwhelmed? Not getting anywhere? It is okay to just start again if you need to. I try so hard to strive for perfection, which is impossible, so I need to accept that. What you make the first time is not always going to be the best, and infact, doing things a few times makes you better at it. Making mistakes is vital to the learning process.
