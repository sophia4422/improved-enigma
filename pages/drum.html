          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">The Challenge</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">
            To design a website and application for subscribers to a drum clinic. The website will include exclusive video content & access to unique features: live video, profile & exclusive drumming events.

        <div class="m-4">
          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Problem</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">
            The Palace Drum Clinic is a charity that aims to provide educational workshops and lessons to schools and organisations. Plenty of world renown drummers from famous bands work with the drum clinic, hence their slogan ‘Be part of Drumming Royalty’ – these drummers create exclusive content for the clinic and attend both virtual and in-person events. 
          </br>
          The current website does not have features to allow for subscribers to access exclusive content. We want to create a website and mobile app that paying subscribers can use to view content, access live lessons, contact drummers and see upcoming events.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="m-4">
          <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Hypothesis</h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">
            An easy to use website and app will increase reach and the audience for the Palace Drum Clinic, improve their drumming ability and increase attendees of drumming events.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="grey-bg mb-5">
          <div class="m-2">
            <h2 class="mb-3 uppercase">Solution</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Design and build a website that will extend the current PDC website. This website will be built using React to allow for more exclusive and adaptable features to be created (rather than the standard Wordpress website). Users will be able to create a personalised account, view and save pre-recorded and live video and purchase tickets for events.

          <p class="mb-4 lead">
            Together with members of the PDC, we decided who the main competitors are. Youtube offers thousands of free drumming videos. Drumeo is a paid service that specialises in online drumming lessons. I analysed the positives and negatives of both competitors.

            I wanted to better understand who the users I was designing for would be.
          </br>
1. Understand users knowledge and opinions of current drumming applications. 
</br>
2. What features would they find useful.
</br>
3. What friction points do drumming learners currently have.
</br>
I surveyed those that currently work for the drum clinic and a selection of those that are beginners to drumming or are intermediate learners (54 users). I gave these users 10 questions to gain quantitative insights.

 Whilst working at the BBC, I have learnt the importance of having a style / design system. The BBC have the 'Global Experience Language', a system of reusable interaction patterns. Even though I was working solo on this project, I knew that creating a mini design system of my own will assist with saving time, keeping things consistent and improve the overall look of the project and be very beneficial for the developer building the application! As a developer myself, I am biased to the last point in particular - having repeatable components makes developing an application much less painful and time consuming.
