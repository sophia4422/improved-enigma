            <p class="lead mb-5">
              My friend Josh, who I had worked with on the Coding Bootcamp, asked me to help design an app that he was going to build for a drumming charity called the Palace Drum Clinic.
              Willing to help my friend and help a charity, I jumped at this opportunity.

                      My first designs were bad, but poor Josh never admitted that. I had jumped straight into designing the prototype, with very little knowledge of a design process.

                      Below you will read about the roadblock I hit, and how my designs improved once I began self-studying the UX design process...

            <p class="mb-5 lead ">
              Design a user-friendly and engaging application that empowers users to improve their drumming skills through high-quality video tutorials and support from world class drumming teachers. The application must be scalable to a mobile and a desktop version. As this is for a charity, it has a very limited budget, and is centered around helping the community.

            <p class="mb-5 lead ">
             As mentioned in the overview, the first thing I did was dive straight into designing the mockup using Photoshop. This was before I knew anything about the UX Design process. I had no idea who my users were, what features I was designing, the architecture of the app - I had no guidelines.</p>

             <p class="lead"> I just started designing what I liked, what I thought would work, with no thought given to any users. I was just thinking of the developer and what would be simple for him to recreate. I was completely biased in the mind of a developer. No wonder it looked pants...

              I hit a road block, I hated my designs and I was lost on the direction of the app. After doing some studying of the UX step process, I decided to start from scratch. I wanted to ensure a user-centered approach, gain insights and develop a better, more organised product.

However, I could not shake the fact that all I wanted to do was get stuck into the high-fidelity design stage.

            The developer and I outlisted the the stages from my user journey and began creating the site map.
            We took our competitors into consideration, and tried to create the web-architecture based around the features that our app contains.

            <p class="mb-3 lead">
              This is where any UX knowledge I had learned took a halt. I knew that you had to wireframe and sketch to begin designing process, but I was ignorant to how to execute this properly. I created some basic wireframes for the purposes of showing the developer, but they were not there to benefit me. All I wanted to do was design the mockup and prototype! 
            </br>
        </br>
            Now that I am better educated on the importance of sketching and wireframing, I understand how valuable they are in planning and sparking ideas. I know my high-fidelity wireframes would have looked so much better if I had known how to develop and design properly.

Heading straight into Figma, armed with only the house-style colours (which I had not even checked for accessibility), the site map and the user persona, I began designing my high-fidelity product and prototype. I cringe at the thought of this now.

   The user can <span class="font-bold">personalise</span> their profile by adding a profile photo and cover photo. All personal details, such as email and subscription type, will only be visible to the user. When the user subscribes to the application, they will be able to access a variety of drumming tutorials and live shows, created by world class drummers.

  </br>
</br>
   Users can view drumming events, that have only been curated by the Palace Drum Clinic. A user can save an event they like the look of (this data will give marketers an idea of event interest), or they can buy tickets for the event - both saved and attending events will be shown only to the user on their profile.
  </br>
</br>
Drumming tutorials are organised by their skill ability (beginner, intermediate etc) and their popularity amongst users. Videos can be viewed on demand and saved to a users personal playlist for later. Scheduled live shows will also be available to view. Videos do not only encompass tutorials, but also interviews and informal chats with the popular drummers, so users can get to know them on a more personal level.
</br>
</br>
Users can look through a list of the drumming artists available on the app and view their public profiles - this includes photos, a bio and the videos created or featuring said artist.

           This prototype was presented to the PDC at their annual drum clinic where product owners feedback was received. The product was granted permission to be built, and currently it is in the works with the developer. Depending on how the community respond to the app will affect whether or not we can bring the product to life past the MVP and create more exciting and unique features.

In the future, we want to develop the application to have a '30 day challenge' section, this is where users complete daily challenges to build up a streak - if they complete 30 days, their skills are statistically likely to have improved, and they win a prize (prize idea pending).

            This was my first 'proper' design project, so to speak, and I would love to start all over again from the beginning and follow the UX design process properly to see what product I would create.

            All of the research, planning and discussion is so valuable in order to design a viable and successful product. It is not all about how the product looks - I have learnt that lesson now. 
        </br>
    </br>
        When I get the chance to repeat this project again for the next stage of designs, I am going to do my utmost to involve as much testing as possible. This product is all about helping the community and inspire people to get involved in drumming, so it is important to get the community's feedback and advice at every stage of development.

          My top takeways:
        </br>
      </br>
          <span class="font-bold">Don't rush into things:</span> All I wanted to do was design the product. I have learnt that skipping steps, and not following the process properly (which in my defence, I didn't know how to do), leads to a poorly executed product. Planning, discussion and research are vital elements to get a better quality result.
        </br>
      </br>
        <span class="font-bold">Designing is like Science:</span> I studied BioMed at Uni and I know the importance of hypothesing, planning and testing - I never thought that these sort of elements would be important in designing. Now I feel that these things are in many ways, more important than the final result itself, because without them, you do not get reliable, repeatable results.
    </br>
</br>
<span class="font-bold">Start from scratch:</span> Hitting a road block? Feeling overwhelmed? Not getting anywhere? It is okay to just start again if you need to. I try so hard to strive for perfection, which is impossible, so I need to accept that. What you make the first time is not always going to be the best, and infact, doing things a few times makes you better at it. Making mistakes is vital to the learning process.
